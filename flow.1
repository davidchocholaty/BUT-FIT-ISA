.SH DESCRIPTION
.B flow
is a tool implementing the NetFlow exporter.
It generates the NetFlow data (NetFlow records) from the captured network data
from the network communication. The captured data are in pcap format and the
resulting NetFlow records are sent to the collector.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-f =\fI<file>\fR
The name of the parsed file.
Default is STDIN.
.TP
.BR \-c =\fI<neflow_collector:port>\fR
Sets the IP address or hostname of the NetFlow collector.
Optionally, also a UDP port can be set.
The default is 127.0.0.1:2055.
.TP
.BR \-a =\fI<active_timer>\fR
Sets the interval in seconds after which active records are exported
to the collector. The default is 60.
.TP
.BR \-i =\fI<seconds>\fR
Sets the interval in seconds after which inactive records are exported
to the collector. The default is 10.
.TP
.BR \-m =\fI<count>\fR
The flow-cache size.
When the maximum size is reached, the oldest record in the cache is exported
to the collector. The default is 1024.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.BR "./flow"
This command-line runs the NetFlow exporter with the default settings
(file: STDIN, netflow_collector:port: 127.0.0.1:2055, active timer: 60,
inactive timer: 10, count: 1024).
.TP
.BR "./flow -f input.pcap -c 192.168.0.1:2055"
This command-line runs the NetFlow exporter with the setting of the input file
to input.pcap and NetFlow collector to 192.168.0.1:2055. Other parameters
are left at default settings.
.TP
.BR "./flow -f input.pcap -c 192.168.127.1"
This command-line runs the NetFlow exporter with the setting of the input file
to input.pcap and NetFlow collector to 192.168.127.1. Other parameters
are left at default settings.
.TP
.BR "./flow -f input.pcap -c 192.168.0.1:2055 -a 360"
This command-line runs the NetFlow exporter with the setting of the input file
to input.pcap, NetFlow collector to 192.168.0.1:2055 and active timer
to 360 seconds. Other parameters are left at default settings.
.TP
.BR "./flow -f input.pcap -c 192.168.0.1:2055 -i 120"
This command-line runs the NetFlow exporter with the setting of the input file
to input.pcap, NetFlow collector to 192.168.0.1:2055 and inactive timer
to 120 seconds. Other parameters are left at default settings.
.TP
.BR "./flow -f input.pcap -c 192.168.0.1:2055 -m 8192"
This command-line runs the NetFlow exporter with the setting of the input file
to input.pcap, NetFlow collector to 192.168.0.1:2055 and count to 8192.
Other parameters are left at default settings.
.TP
.BR "./flow -f input.pcap -c 192.168.0.1:2055 -a 600 -i 360 -m 4096"
This command-line runs the NetFlow exporter with the setting of the input file
to input.pcap, NetFlow collector to 192.168.0.1:2055, active timer
to 600 seconds, inactive timer to 360 seconds and count to 4096.
